An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of 
rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate 
with each other. In the context of a backend, an API typically refers to the interface
that the server exposes to the client. This interface defines the types of requests that the 
server can handle and the format of the responses.

api is like a language or menu that a user can order from the backend/kitchen almost in a specific language etc..
    the api like the menu provided by the server/kitchen which tells the user/client/guest what they can order from the server/kitchen and the format of the results/food they will receive and how to order it in a specific manner the kitchen/server will understand.

The database is pretty much the fridge that holds the data/ingredients

the server and database make up the backend, which communicate with eachother, and with the front-end through API's (like a menu)
the server also uses the api to send a response back to the client 
The front end also sends requests to the backend through the api and uses the responses to display the information to the user  
    the frontend could be like a waiter that gets orders from the user through how they interact with the with site displayed
    and then send the information/request to the server/kitchen, and get the information back and listens to the cook how to organize the food presentation/website presentation. which the user/guest will ultimately see.
